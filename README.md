These are Intermediate JavaScript practice projects I worked on.

Pig Game: https://georgey764.github.io/JavaScript-Intermediate/Pig%20Game/index.html
  Roll dice to get points.
  Roll a one and you lose your current points and your turn ends. 
  If you click hold then you save your current points and add it to your score and your turn ends.
  First to 50 wins.
